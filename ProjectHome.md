This class was written to provide Java's ByteBuffer functionality in many of my internal C++ projects. Feel free to make any suggestions for improving the code or request any features that could be beneficial to a variety of applications that may use this class.

# Why Byte Buffer? #
  * Relative and Absolute get() & put() methods
  * Easier to work with than a raw byte array
  * Read and Write large amounts of data
  * Easy way to manipulate or create custom data structures

# Examples #
Included on SVN are examples of ByteBuffer in use. If you've come up with a creative way to use ByteBuffer, feel free to submit your code!
  * HTTP: Request & Response parsers
  * Packets - Parse or Create custom packets to send over the network in a quick and easy manner
